"""Regenerate Mailman specific aliases from scratch.

The actual output depends on the value of the `MTA' variable in your mm_cfg.py
file.

Usage: genaliases [options]
Options:

    -q/--quiet
        Some MTA output can include more verbose help text.  Use this to tone
        down the verbosity.

    -h/--help
        Print this message and exit.
