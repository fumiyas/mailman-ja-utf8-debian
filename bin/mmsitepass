"""Set the site password, prompting from the terminal.

The site password can be used in most if not all places that the list
administrator's password can be used, which in turn can be used in most places
that a list users password can be used.

Usage: %(PROGRAM)s [options] [password]

Options:

    -c/--listcreator
        Set the list creator password instead of the site password.  The list
        creator is authorized to create and remove lists, but does not have
        the total power of the site administrator.

    -h/--help
        Print this help message and exit.

If password is not given on the command line, it will be prompted for.
