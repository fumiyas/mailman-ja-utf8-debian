"""Move a message from the shunt queue to the original queue.

Usage: %(PROGRAM)s [options] [directory]

Where:

    -h / --help
        Print help and exit.

Optional `directory' specifies a directory to dequeue from other than
qfiles/shunt.  *** Warning ***  Do not unshunt messages that weren't
shunted to begin with.  For example, running unshunt on qfiles/out/
will result in losing all the messages in that queue.
