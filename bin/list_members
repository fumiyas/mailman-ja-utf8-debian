"""List all the members of a mailing list.

Usage: %(PROGRAM)s [options] listname

Where:

    --output file
    -o file
        Write output to specified file instead of standard out.

    --regular / -r
        Print just the regular (non-digest) members.

    --digest[=kind] / -d [kind]
        Print just the digest members.  Optional argument can be "mime" or
        "plain" which prints just the digest members receiving that kind of
        digest.

    --nomail[=why] / -n [why]
        Print the members that have delivery disabled.  Optional argument can
        be "byadmin", "byuser", "bybounce", or "unknown" which prints just the
        users who have delivery disabled for that reason.  It can also be
        "enabled" which prints just those member for whom delivery is
        enabled.

    --fullnames / -f
        Include the full names in the output.

    --preserve / -p
        Output member addresses case preserved the way they were added to the
        list.  Otherwise, addresses are printed in all lowercase.

    --invalid / -i
        Print only the addresses in the membership list that are invalid.
        Ignores -r, -d, -n.

    --unicode / -u
        Print addresses which are stored as Unicode objects instead of normal
        string objects.  Ignores -r, -d, -n.

    --help
    -h
        Print this help message and exit.

    listname is the name of the mailing list to use.

Note that if neither -r or -d is supplied, both regular members are printed
first, followed by digest members, but no indication is given as to address
status.
