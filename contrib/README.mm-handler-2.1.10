mm-handler-2.1.10 is based on the original mm-handler.  See README.mm-handler
for much important information that is not repeated here.

This version was updated by David Champion <dgc@uchicago.edu> to add the
ability to select a subset of list addresses to accept and to add switches
to not generate bounces for non-existent lists and unaccepted or invalid
list addresses.  It was further debugged and polished by Kenneth Porter
<shiva@sewingwitch.com>.

Kenneth added syslog logging using the perl Unix::Syslog module (available
from CPAN and other repositories).  If you don't have that module, you must
either install it or remove the module references and syslog references from
mm-handler-2.1.10.

This is a work in progress.  The major thing left to do is to arrange for
it to exit with an appropriate exit code (e.g. EX_NOUSER or EX_UNAVAILABLE)
when the message is undeliverable.  This in turn requires that mm-handler
be invoked separately for each message recipient address.  The sample
mailman.mc file is set up this way and mentions that the 'm' and 'n' flags
should not be used, but mm-handler contains an address processing loop in
case the 'm' flag is included in it's invocation.  This should be changed
to log an appropriate error if mm-handler is invoked with multiple recipient
addresses.
