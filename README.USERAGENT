INTRODUCTION

    Mailman is compliant with RFC 2369, which specifies a number of
    List-* headers that mailing list management software should add to
    every outbound email message.  These headers are designed to make
    it easy for mail user agents (MUAs) to assist users in common
    mailing list tasks, such as getting help or unsubscribing.

    At this time, not all MUAs understand the RFC 2369 headers, and
    instead of suppressing those List-* headers, they show them to the
    user.  Many list managers report that this can generate a large
    amount of support requests from their user base.

    In Mailman 2.0, you cannot turn off the List-* headers without
    hacking the Mailman source.  Because these headers are in the
    long-term benefit of end-users, it is strongly encouraged to leave
    these headers in and lobby the MUA vendors to support them.  In
    the meantime, you can provide your users with the following
    information to help them suppress these headers.


EUDORA USERS

    Mike Noyes provides the following suggestion:

    You can hide the new list headers. Edit your Eudora.ini file, and
    add this line under [settings].

    TabooHeaders=List,X-UID,Received,Status,X-UIDL,Message,In-Reply, \
    X-Priority,Mime-Version,Content,X-Persona,Resent-Message,References, \
    Return,X400,X-400,Mail-System,Errors-To,X-List,Delivery,Disposition, \
    X-Juno,Precedence,X-Attachments,X-MSMail,X-MimeOLE,X-Nav

    note: everything other than "List" is the default
