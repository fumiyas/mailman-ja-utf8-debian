_Description: Which languages to support?  
 For each supported language Debian Mailman stores default language
 specific texts in /etc/mailman/LANG/ giving them conffile like
 treatment with the help of ucf.  This means approximately 150kB for
 each supported language on the root FS.
 .
 If you need a different set of languages at a later time, just run
 dpkg-reconfigure mailman.
 .
 NOTE: Languages enabled on existing mailing lists are forcibly re-
 enabled when deselected and mailman needs at least one language for
 displaying it's messages.

 .
 To create the list, run "newlist mailman" and follow the instructions
 on-screen.  Note that you also need to start mailman after that,
 using /etc/init.d/mailman start.

Description: Old queue files present
 The directory /var/lib/mailman/qfiles contains files.  It needs to be

 when it is finished) or remove those files.  Note that removing the
 files will lose some emails sent to lists.
