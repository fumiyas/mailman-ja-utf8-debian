_Description: Missing site list
 Mailman needs a so-called "site list", which is the list from which
 password reminders and such are sent out from.  This list needs to be
 created before mailman will start.
 .
 To create the list, run "newlist mailman" and follow the instructions
 on-screen.  Note that you also need to start mailman after that,
 using /etc/init.d/mailman start.
