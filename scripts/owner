"""Send a message to the mailing list owner.

All messages to a list's -owner address should be piped through this script.
The -owner address is defined to be delivered directly to the list owners plus
the list moderators, with no intervention for bounce processing.

Stdin is the mail message, and argv[1] is the name of the target mailing list.
