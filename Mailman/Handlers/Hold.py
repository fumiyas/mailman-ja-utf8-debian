"""Determine whether this message should be held for approval.

This modules tests only for hold situations, such as messages that are too
large, messages that have potential administrivia, etc.  Definitive approvals
or denials are handled by a different module.

If no determination can be made (i.e. none of the hold criteria matches), then
we do nothing.  If the message must be held for approval, then the hold
database is updated and any administrator notification messages are sent.
Finally an exception is raised to let the pipeline machinery know that further
message handling should stop.
