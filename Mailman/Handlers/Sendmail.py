"""Deliver a message via command-line drop-off.

WARNING WARNING WARNING: This module is provided for example purposes only.
It should not be used in a production environment for reasons described
below.  Because of this, you must explicitly enable it with by editing the
code.  See the WARN section in the process() function.

This module delivers the message via the command line interface to the
sendmail program.  It should work for sendmail clones like Postfix.  It is
expected that sendmail handles final delivery, message queueing, etc.  The
recipient list is only trivially split so that the command line is less than
about 3k in size.

SECURITY WARNING: Because this module uses os.popen(), it goes through the
shell.  This module does not scan the arguments for potential exploits and so
it should be considered unsafe for production use.  For performance reasons,
it's not recommended either -- use the SMTPDirect delivery module instead,
even if you're using the sendmail MTA.

DUPLICATES WARNING: Using this module can cause duplicates to be delivered to
your membership, depending on your MTA!  E.g. It is known that if you're using
the sendmail MTA, and if a message contains a single dot on a line by itself,
your list members will receive many duplicates.

    This function processes the message by handing off the delivery of the
