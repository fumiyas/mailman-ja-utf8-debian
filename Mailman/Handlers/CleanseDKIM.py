"""Remove any "DomainKeys" (or similar) header lines.

recipient to detect forgery or tampering in transit, and the modifications
made by Mailman to the headers and body of the message will cause these keys
to appear invalid.  Removing them will at least avoid this misleading result,
and it will also give the MTA the opportunity to regenerate valid keys
