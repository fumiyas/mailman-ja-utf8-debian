"""Parse bounce messages generated by Postfix.

This also matches something called `Keftamail' which looks just like Postfix
bounces with the word Postfix scratched out and the word `Keftamail' written
in in crayon.

It also matches something claiming to be `The BNS Postfix program', and
`SMTP_Gateway'.  Everybody's gotta be different, huh?
